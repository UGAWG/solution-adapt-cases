# Hemisphere Cylinder

This is the case described as 
[3D ONERA M6 Wing Validation Case](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/onerawingnumerics_val.html).
It is part of the Solver Technology Discussion Group (STDG) SciTech-2018 special session "RANS solutions for 3D benchmark configurations"
 In this geometry, the trailing edge of the wing has been made sharp for the purposes of this particular CFD exercise, as described in [1] and [2].
