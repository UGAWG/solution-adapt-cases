# Aft Closure Hemisphere Cylinder

This is the case described as 
[Special Purpose Grid with aft closure - 3D Hemisphere Cylinder (NEW)](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/hc3dnumericspart2_gridsclosed.html).
It is part of the Solver Technology Discussion Group (STDG) SciTech-2018 special session "RANS solutions for 3D benchmark configurations"
The geometry is taken from the experimental model studied by Hsieh [1]
modified with an aft closure to avoid an outflow boundary that
intersects the geometry.

# Simulation Conditions (for Half Model with Symmetry)

- 0.6 Mach number
- 0, 5, 10, 15, and 19 degrees angle of attack
- 0.35 million Reynolds number based on diameter
- reference temperature 540 degrees Rankine
- 1 grid unit length diameter
- 5 grid unit squared reference area (half model)
