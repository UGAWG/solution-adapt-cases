# Hemisphere Cylinder

This is the case described as 
[3D Hemisphere Cylinder Validation Case (NEW)](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/hc3dnumericspart2_val.html).
It is part of the Solver Technology Discussion Group (STDG) SciTech-2018 special session "RANS solutions for 3D benchmark configurations"
The geometry is taken from the experimental model studied by Tsieh. [1]
